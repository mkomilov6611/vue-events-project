Here are the commands you’ll want handy once you have it installed. I’m assuming you already have npm installed.

To install dependencies:

```
    $ npm install
```

To run the server:

```
    $ npm run serve
```

To get json-server, which we use for our mock database (Starting on API calls with Axios)

```
    $ npm install -g json-server
```

To run the mock database

```
    $ json-server --watch db.json
```
